|| About:
|| I decided to make Miranda the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-Miranda) as Miranda is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the Miranda programming language. It only makes sense to Miranda the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
